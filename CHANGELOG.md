# Changelog

All notable changes to `logseq-cli` are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-06

### Added

- `get-page --with-ids`: Prefix every block line with its UUID. Output format
  `<uuid>\t<indent-tabs>\t<content>`. Eliminates the `--json | jq` workaround
  for downstream tools that need the UUID alongside the rendered content.
- `insert-block --tree`: Batch-insert a block hierarchy in a single call.
  Accepts either tab-indented text (same shape as `--content`) or a JSON tree
  (`[{"content": "...", "children": [...]}]`). Auto-detected from the first
  non-whitespace character. Combines with `--child-of UUID` (insert under
  block) or `--page NAME --top-level` (insert at page top). Returns UUIDs in
  DFS pre-order. `--content` and `--tree` are mutually exclusive.
- `add-note-content --under-heading "## X"`: Heading-aware insertion for
  non-journal pages. The heading is created if it does not exist; the content
  is inserted as children. Mirrors `add-journal-block --under-heading` for
  the project/topic page case.
- Global `--no-cache` flag: Bypass the in-memory read cache for one
  invocation.

### Changed

- `get-todos` plain-text output now shows the page name inline per task
  (`MARKER [Page] preview`) instead of grouping tasks under a page header.
  JSON output is unchanged — `page` was already part of each task entry.

### Performance

- **In-memory read cache** for the `LogseqAPI` client. Read methods
  (`getPage`, `getBlock`, `getPageBlocksTree`, `getPageProperties`,
  `getPageLinkedReferences`, `getAllPages`, `getUserConfigs`,
  `datascriptQuery`) cache responses for 60 seconds by default. Mutating
  methods (`createPage`, `deletePage`, `renamePage`, `appendBlockInPage`,
  `insertBlock`, `updateBlock`, `removeBlock`, `upsertBlockProperty`,
  `removeBlockProperty`, `setBlockProperty`, `replaceText`) invalidate the
  whole cache. Configurable via `LOGSEQ_CLI_CACHE_TTL` (seconds, `0`
  disables). Bypass per call with `--no-cache`.
- **Parallel fetch in `get-journal-range`**. Journals in the requested range
  are fetched through a `ThreadPoolExecutor` (5 workers default,
  configurable via `LOGSEQ_CLI_RANGE_WORKERS`, range 1–16). Output order
  remains stable (sorted by date). A failure on any single day is embedded
  as an `error` field on that entry; the rest of the range continues to
  process.
- `get-page --resolve-refs` and `get-journal-range --resolve-refs` now
  documented and test-covered. Block references `((uuid))` are resolved
  inline to `<content> ↳ <source-page>`, removing the need for follow-up
  `get-block` calls.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-06

Initial baseline (tagged `baseline-2026-05-06`). 30 commands across pages,
journals, blocks, search, properties, page management, and graph analysis.
